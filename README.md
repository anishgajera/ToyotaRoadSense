### Toyota RoadSense - Done Driving Dangerously
Our project for the HackUTD IX Toyota Challenge

**Inspiration**
---
- Driving has become second nature to most people, and it is easy to forget how much danger is on the road each time a person gets behind the wheel. Our product, Toyota RoadSense - Done Driving Dangerously, optimizes the average driver's experience in a hands-on approach to show the user Weather data, Speed + Location, Speed + Weather, and Traffic Data that could potentially affect their travel and allows them to re-route to their destination should they choose to.
---

**What it does**
---
- Weather data - shows impacts of weather on the route the user plans to utilize
- Speed + Location - highlights the range of speeding drivers in a particular location
- Speed + Weather - recommends speed to the user based on the weather for a particular location
- Traffic data - shows route hazards due to traffic

- Data obtained would be from Toyota's current user vehicle data
